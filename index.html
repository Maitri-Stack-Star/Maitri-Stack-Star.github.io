But remember one bad day doesn’t undo who you are or everything you’re doing right. You’re allowed to have off days. I’m still proud of you and while I might not be there physically, I'm definetly here with you virtually",
        "Today might seem like nothing is working and everything is wrong, but that's not true - its a lie told by bad please. Please don’t believe everything today is telling you. This moment will pass. And when it does, I’ll still be here, cheering you and loving you through it. I love you and so do a lot of other people",
        "If today feels like survival mode, that’s okay. You don’t need to be productive, positive, or put together. You don't need to be at 100 percent all the time. Today you just need to get through and you don't need to do it alone - I'm here for you and will alway have space and energy for you. Remember my love, even when things are feeling uncertain and low, one thing will alway remain stable and true: you are loved, not for what you do, not for how well you cope but for the person you are. I love you, "

        "My love let me tell this out loud: the way you show up means more to me than you realise, you treat me with kindness and care (even when I’m not at my easiest). You meet my emotions with patience and understanding, not judgment, and that tells me so much about the kind of person you are (exactly the one I want to spend rest of my life with). You don’t have to be perfect to be worthy, you already are so perfect my love. The way you choose understanding, the way you stay gentle, that’s not small and I really do appreciate it",
        "I want you to know how safe I feel with you. You give me space to have moods, to make mistakes, to learn and to grow and you stay steady throughout while I do. That kind of patience is rare, it is something you choose over and over, and that kind of love you give me matters to me. You never make me feel small when I make mistakes, instead you let me evolve, and believe in me and us. Please remember: someone who can love like that is alway enough and 1000% times better than any person on this planet.",
        "I hope you know this: when I look at you, I don’t see someone falling short, I see someone trying to awaly be their best version for themself, us and anothers. I am proud of you, not for being flawless, but for being so caring, patient, open to trying and for alway making effort. You don’t have to earn that pride my love, you already have it, "

        "You are not invesible or do not matter, craving that deep connect is a human and normal. But my love, this letter exist because you crossed my mind, and because your presence in my life matters more than you know. You might feel lonely today, and that is okay, but you are never alone",
        "Feeling lonely doesn’t mean you’re unlovable, it means you crave connection, and that is a beautiful thing. Just know that if I were there, I would sit beside you without saying much, just letting you feel less alone in the quiet. And you are never meant or expected to do this alone"

        "If you’re reading this, I probably messed up, and I’m sorry. I never want to be the reason you feel hurt, unheard, or frustrated. Your feelings are valid, even if they are messy or angry right now. I care more about understanding you, than you currently feel like. And I promise you it is us against the problem not you vs me",

You don’t have to push these feelings away, i'm not afraid of them or of you having them. We are allowed to have moments where things feel unclear, but that doesn’t undo what we have built, we will be okay I promise",
        "I know the ups and downs we have can feel exhausting sometimes. One day feels steady, the next feels confusing, and it can make you wonder what it all means. However, I want you to know this: ups and downs are part of something alive, not something broken. Its okay for us to not alway be perfect or certain, but remember I'll alway keep showing up for us and care. Even when things feel complicated, my heart is still here and yours, choosing patience over fear. We don't have to solve everything today, just stay kind to each other as we move through this",
        "Remember its okay to question whether we will make it through, but also remember one uncertain day does not define us. I am willing to try, willing to learn and willing to grow alongside you. This moment is just that: a moment, not a verdict. We will be okay (remember what you wrote behind our pic). And I’m still here alway, choosing you and us."

Until then, let this letter be proof that you’re on my mind too and I miss you too",

That is something to be sad about, it is something to celebrate and be comforted by. We miss each other because we love each other so much, how beautiful is that",

        " Overthinking has a way of pulling you into futures that haven’t happened and getting you stuck in that loop. I want you to ground yourself, take a breathe, name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste, come back here, to what is real right now. Right now, you are safe, right now, you are cared for, right now you are loved. If something needs attention, we will face it together with patience, you don’t have to carry every possibility alone. Clarity will comes with time, not pressure",

I’m grateful for you, for your presence, your effort, your care, and I hope in this moment you know how deeply you are loved, just as you are. I also hope you know how easy it is to love you, not because you’re perfect, but because you’re you. I am yours and I'll continue to be yours. I love you so much"
